# Quantitative Research at JP Morgan Chase - Forage Virtual Internship

## Introduction

Welcome to the Quantitative Research Virtual Internship at JP Morgan Chase. This program is designed to provide you with hands-on experience in financial data analysis, risk assessment, and modeling. Throughout this internship, you will engage in a series of tasks that mirror the real-world challenges faced by quantitative researchers at JP Morgan Chase. By completing these tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of financial markets, risk management, and predictive modeling.

## Task 1: Investigate and Analyze Price Data

**What you'll learn:**
- An overview of commodity storage contracts
- How to extrapolate data from external feeds to provide granular insights

**What you'll do:**
- Write code that analyzes data to take a date as input and return a price for past and future estimates

## Task 2: Price a Commodity Storage Contract

**What you'll learn:**
- How to write a function that takes particular inputs and gives back the value of a contract

**What you'll do:**
- Create a prototype pricing model that can go through further validation and testing before being put into production

## Task 3: Credit Risk Analysis

**What you'll learn:**
- How to choose appropriate independent variables from a dataset that will accurately predict the outcome of a chosen dependent variable
- The importance of using available data to predict customer trends and actions

**What you'll do:**
- Build a model using Python that will estimate the probability of default for a borrower

## Task 4: Bucket FICO Scores

**What you'll learn:**
- How to apply statistical formulas to business solutions
- The importance of breaking down a large dataset using machine learning methods

**What you'll do:**
- Deploy detailed Python code to strategically bucket customers with various FICO scores in order to narrow in on the probability of default
